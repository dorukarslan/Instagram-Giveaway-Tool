# Instagram-Giveaway-Tool
Python Selenium automation to tag followers in a text file to an intended post

**Working Principle**
In order to use it, you need to fill some parts in the code block.

Firstly, in order to use it you need to fill 'log' and 'pas' variables with your Instagram username and password in order to login.

Then, you need to fill related post url part(where **_'giveaway post's URL here'_** is written) with intended Instagram post's URL.

Lastly, you need to write path of the text file that contains your followers. In order to tag your whole followers three by three you need to use my first project in GitHub [Instagram-Followers](https://github.com/dorukarslan/Instagram-Followers). 


Then you need to write its path  to fill in the file variable(where **_'your path here'_** is written).

**Note that if you do not want to tag your whole followers, you can create your own text file that contains your followers you want to tag, and use its path.However, your text files concepts must be similar(One name in every line!).**
